# Demo Video Script (3 minutes)

## 0:00-0:30 - Hook & Problem (30 sec)
**Visual:** Show blockchain explorer with public transactions

"Every transaction you make on blockchain is completely public. Your balance, your activity, your financial behavior - all visible to everyone. This is like having your bank statement posted on the internet."

## 0:30-1:00 - Solution Intro (30 sec)
**Visual:** Landing page

"Vex.zk Protocol solves this with probabilistic identity. Instead of ONE address that everyone can track, you exist as a cloud of multiple addresses. Observers know you're ONE of them, but they can't tell which."

## 1:00-1:30 - Interactive Demo (30 sec)
**Visual:** Demo page guessing game

"Let me show you. Here are 10 addresses. I'm hiding in one of them. Can you find me? This is how privacy works - hiding in the crowd. And this isn't just theory..."

## 1:30-2:00 - Live Creation (30 sec)
**Visual:** Create page

"Watch me create a real Vexil Vexil Probability Cloud on Solana devnet. Boom! 10 addresses generated. I'm one of them, but you can't tell which."

## 2:00-2:30 - Dashboard & Verification (30 sec)
**Visual:** Dashboard with clouds

"Here's my dashboard showing all my clouds. Each one increases my privacy. And this is all verifiable on-chain. See? Real Solana blockchain."

## 2:30-3:00 - Technical & Use Cases (30 sec)
**Visual:** Architecture diagram or code

"Under the hood: Noir zero-knowledge circuits for ring signatures, Solana smart contracts for on-chain verification, beautiful TypeScript SDK. Perfect for crypto whales, traders, businesses, or anyone who values privacy."
